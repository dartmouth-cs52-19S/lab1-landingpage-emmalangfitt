# Lab 1 - Landing Page

## Assignment
I used [Houseparty.com](https://houseparty.com/) as inspiration to create a website for the student band *BDE*. I really liked the colors and blocky structure of the original site, so I kept most of the design the same and just replaced the content with information and photos related to the group. I also added in a few lab-specific elements like the top navigation bar and size-responsive menu. My version is hosted [here](https://dartmouth-cs52-19s.github.io/lab1-landingpage-emmalangfitt/).
